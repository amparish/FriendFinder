# FriendFinder (Node and Express Servers)

### Overview

The goal of this project was to build a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application, similar to a dating app. This full-stack site takes in results from users' surveys, then compares their answers with those from other users. The app then displays the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

This project allowed for practice using the Express NPM package to handle routing, and deploying an app to Heroku.
